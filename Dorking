** Automating Dorking Searches

1. Choose a Programming Language:
   - Python is commonly used for web scraping and automation tasks.

2. Install Required Libraries:
   - You might need libraries like `requests` for making HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML.

3. Set Up Google Search API:
   - Google Custom Search JSON API can be used to automate Google dorking searches.

4. Obtain API Key:
   - Sign up for the Google Custom Search JSON API and get an API key.

5. Craft Your Queries:
   - Define a list of dorking queries that you want to search for.

6. Build the Automation Script:
   - Write a Python script that sends API requests to Google with your dorking queries.

   Example Python Script:
   #+begin_src python
   import requests

   API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
   SEARCH_ENGINE_ID = 'YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID'

   dorking_queries = [
       "site:example.com filetype:pdf",
       "intitle:keyword",
       # Add more queries here
   ]

   def search(query):
       url = f"https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?q={query}&key={API_KEY}&cx={SEARCH_ENGINE_ID}"
       response = requests.get(url)
       data = response.json()
       return data

   for query in dorking_queries:
       search_results = search(query)
       for item in search_results.get('items', []):
           title = item.get('title', '')
           link = item.get('link', '')
           print(f"Title: {title}\nLink: {link}\n")
   #+end_src

7. Extract and Store Information:
   - Modify the script to extract and store relevant information from the search results.

8. Run the Script:
   - Run your Python script to automate the dorking searches.

9. Implement Automation Tools:
   - Consider using automation tools like Selenium for interacting with websites directly if required.

10. Respect Ethical and Legal Boundaries:
    - Be mindful of the ethical and legal considerations while automating searches.

    Remember to stay within the bounds of legality and ethics when automating dorking searches. Always respect website terms of use, robots.txt files, and avoid causing harm or violating privacy. Additionally, search engines may have limitations on the number of queries you can make within a certain time frame, so ensure you're following their guidelines.


** Dorking Checklist

1. Define Your Goals:
   - Clearly outline your objectives and the specific information you're looking for through dorking.

2. Choose the Right Search Engine:
   - Select the search engine that aligns with your goals (e.g., Google for general information, Shodan for IoT devices).

3. Understand Basic Search Operators:
   - Familiarize yourself with basic operators like quotes for exact matches, OR for alternatives, and - (minus) for exclusions.

4. Master Advanced Operators:
   - Learn advanced operators like site:, filetype:, intitle:, inurl:, intext:, related:, cache:, link:, info:, allintitle:, allinurl: for more targeted results.

5. Refine Keywords:
   - Use relevant and specific keywords to narrow down your search.

6. Site-Specific Searches:

7. Filetype Searches:
   - Use the "filetype:" operator to locate specific types of files (e.g., PDFs, spreadsheets).

8. Title and URL Searches:
   - Employ "intitle:" and "inurl:" operators to find keywords in titles and URLs.

9. Textual Content Searches:
   - Use "intext:" to locate keywords within the body text of web pages.

10. Related and Cached Content:
    - Utilize "related:" for similar websites and "cache:" to view cached versions of pages.

11. Link and Info Searches:
    - Explore backlinks with the "link:" operator and gather site information with "info:".

12. Ethical and Legal Considerations:
    - Ensure your dorking activities are within ethical boundaries and respect site terms of use.
    - Do not attempt to access unauthorized or private information.
    - Be aware of potential legal implications of your searches.

13. Cross-Reference Information:
