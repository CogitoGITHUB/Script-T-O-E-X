* Osint

** Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) involves gathering publicly available data from various sources, including the internet, social media platforms, and traditional media outlets like TV, newspapers, and journals, to assess a case or situation.

The acquired information can include text, images, videos, and profiles, which need to be processed, assessed, and stored according to the analyst's goals.

As the CIA’s website states, “Information does not have to be secret to be valuable”.

*** The Definition of OSINT

While exploring the online world, you’re bound to encounter open source information: data that is publicly available to view, collect, and analyze. This type of data can be useful for online researchers or investigators, thanks to its highly accessible nature. You only need to search for a simple phrase on the web to find millions of detail-rich resources on your chosen subject.

However, open source intelligence can become more difficult to acquire on certain websites and platforms. Though the open web is typically just that—wide open for internet users to access—modern websites and popular social media platforms now require users to create accounts in order to enter. In this new guarded online environment, analysts and researchers can no longer collect all OSINT passively. Instead, they must create accounts and clear barriers of entry to gain access to some information. With this variation in barriers to data, online users have to adjust their information-collection methods in web spaces that are more secured. This represents the key difference between obtaining **passive** and **active** OSINT.

*** Passive vs. Active OSINT

Passive and active OSINT each require a different level of effort and precision from the online user.

*** Passive OSINT: Collecting with a wide and invisible net

If you consider the word “passive,” which can mean “unassuming,” you could visualize a collector of passive OSINT as someone who quietly absorbs information on the web. Analysts obtain passive open source intelligence in a simplified manner; picture a fisherman who releases a net underwater, allowing hundreds of fish to swim inside. Information collected passively might include the headlining articles on a global online news source, or the popular posts of a public social media user. While in search of passive OSINT, users may also want to avoid drawing attention to their activities. These users would rather remain invisible to their research subjects to avoid retribution. They could also skew data results by revealing their intentions.

*** Active OSINT: Collecting with a trained fishing pole

On the opposite side of the OSINT spectrum, active open source intelligence implies a dynamic approach to locating public data. With active open source intelligence, researchers need basic credentials, such as emails and usernames, to first gain access to sites that hold valuable data. The information you might collect as an “active OSINT analyst” could be less obvious to the typical online user. Though you’re still acquiring public information, these details may have been obscured or archived. This makes the information slightly more difficult to find.

You might also not worry about revealing your presence to subjects of inquiry when performing active OSINT. For example, you could choose to download a PDF file linked on a research subject’s blog. Or, you might ask to become friends with someone on their Facebook page to view their status updates. If we’re sticking with the fishing analogy, active OSINT discards a net in favor of a pole for a more targeted collection method.

*** Why Understanding Different OSINT Types Matters

Intelligence gathering on public online spaces varies in difficulty. Web researchers need to acquire different skillsets and technologies if they want to collect a full breadth of information. Understanding different types of open source intelligence and collection methods can help you decide where to invest your time and resources when [building your OSINT toolkit](https://ntrepidcorp.com/case-studies/osint-training-activate-your-open-source-research-capabilities/).


** Basics of OSINT Essay

*** A list of fundamental steps to follow

***** Introduction*

In an Open-Source Intelligence Investigation (OSINT) there will be several steps to follow and may vary depending on business needs, field, and required deliverables. The book *Open-Source Intelligence Techniques* by Michael Bazzell describes an effective framework for developing a workflow of an OSINT investigation.

Although investigation scope, timeframe, and deliverables may change, having a standard framework to follow is important, similar to constructing incident response plans. The investigations have an operating procedure that then helps to gather the most information possible in a systematic manner.

***** OSINT Investigation Steps**

1. **Scope, Deliverables, Planning Phase and Tools**

During this phase of an investigation, the scope or what is on- and off-limits should be defined. For example, if investigating an internet protocol address, the investigator may not care about social media usage attached to the address. Whether to include that information depends on the deliverable, referred to as an “OSINT Report.” Additionally, a vital part of this phase would depend on the scope, ensuring that all tools and computers used are up to date. It is also important to follow a clear chain of custody, especially if working with compute forensics.

   - **Collection**

In this phase of the investigation, evidence should be collected and compiled in an easy-to-use database. This stage is less about verifying accuracy of the data, more so collecting it to be analyzed later. As per the scope, collection of data could include the following: network logs, social media logs, telephone, email, photos, and videos. Automating this step and using software like Spiderfoot or Maltego (linked to a centralized database) would be a plus here, as it will make it easier to craft the deliverable.

   - **Processing (analyzing the data)**

After the collection phase, the data must be processed and analyzed for accuracy, relevance, and help in creating a complete picture. Data that is not relevant should be discarded, and data that is relevant should be catalogued and inspected.

   - **Deliverable Phase**

At this phase, the OSINT investigation should be nearly concluded. Depending on the deliverable required, this may be a time-consuming process. The deliverable may contain several technical details and require a simplified format for presentation purposes.

   - **Post OSINT investigation**

This phase may be optional depending on the organization. Once the investigation is concluded, the team should reflect on the process and evaluate the overall performance. What tools were used? Were they effective? What did the team spend the most time on? Can any processes be automated? All are valid avenues of discussion, so the next OSINT investigation can be more effective.

**Anatomy of an OSINT Report**

As per Bazzell (2021), documentation and reports are the “bread and butter” of OSINT investigations. His examples of an OSINT report are thorough, although written from a law enforcement perspective. His template lends itself to a concise and comprehensive report. It can be likened to a “resume” of a given investigation, sharing all the critical details and items collected. I need to stress that this template may be unsuitable given different investigations, but it is a good starting point. The below table provides an overview and summary of Bazzell’s recommendation:

**OSINT Report Table (Bazzell, 2021)**

| Filing information | Photo of the subject, organization doing investigation, date completed |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Summary of findings | An executive style summary detailing the finding of the investigation.      |
| Subject ID          | Personal information of the subject, such as but not limited to: Name, Address, Phone, Date of Birth, Associates, employer information |
| Alternate Identities and Associations | Email addresses, usernames, social media (Facebook, Twitter), Domain information, forums frequented |
| Photo/Videos        | A short description of any videos/photos in the report, as well as their source. |
| Attachments         | Other supplementary information contained in the report. This includes but is not limited to criminal records, photographs, videos, credit reports, threat assessments |

**Online Investigation Policy**

The deliverable for an online investigation report may vary widely between organizations. In general, an online investigation report should be a “digital resume” of the subject. Usernames, aliases, social media sites frequented should be included. Additionally, any associates the subject talks to may also be included (and could spawn its own investigation).

**Ethics in Open-Source Intelligence Gathering**

Before I begin, I need to state I have some strong ethical views on personal information and feel that the ethics on OSINT could be a book. Individuals deserve to know how their personal information is shared and used by companies, especially if law enforcement is using it in an investigation. Once data is “on the web” publicly, it can virtually always be found again. Most of the time the data is something innocent, like pet picture; other times, it could be more damaging or personal, like an expunged arrest record or deferred conviction otherwise not allowed for public viewing. Ethics are subjective, so this is more of a philosophical debate. In an ideal world, OSINT investigations would use discretion and judgement calls on how data was obtained, and organizational polices would also be in place to ensure sourced material is not maliciously used or obtained through illegal means. In practice, this is not always the case.

Most readings on OSINT investigations do not delve into ethics, instead focusing on finding any information relevant to the subject. In some cases, this even includes leaked information (such as a compromised website that had a database of personal information, which is then sold to an illegitimate organization, then cataloged and sold to legitimate agencies). In the above example, I find it highly unethical to do this, but it is often done, by groups such as law enforcement, debt collectors, and background check agencies. This is referred to as parallel construction or evidence laundering.

As per Reuters, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has been using parallel construction/evidence laundering in their investigations on subjects, using illegally obtained evidence via the National Security Agencies (NSA) wiretap program. This “illegal” evidence was used to then gain legal evidence, was never disclosed to defendants, which under the law would have most likely meant entire cases thrown out. Depending on the nature of the crimes, some law enforcement agencies and civilians would not see a problem in this practice, since a criminal
