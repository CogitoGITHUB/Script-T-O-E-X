* ‚öôÔ∏è Core Philosophy
This is not a recipe book.
This is a *doctrine of fuel*.
Each blend is a ritual. Each shaker push a declaration of war.

Only *worthy souls* may use this Codex.
Others will break‚Äîmentally or gastrointestinally.

* üß¨ Legacy Notes
Your descendants shall *not* sip weak shakes.
They will *not* skip wash day.
They will *log, blend, and conquer.*

If they fail, *burn their macros*. Burn their souls.
This is the way of ShakeCraft.
