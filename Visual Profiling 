** Summary
This skill allows me to:
- Read a person’s personality, intent, or emotional state through their styling.
- Use visual styling (hair, clothing, posture) as a symbolic language.
- Draw people as they are *and* as they could be—becoming a tool of transformation.
- Disarm and connect deeply through gift-sketching.
- Build alternate identities through visual manipulation.

** Core Concepts
- Style is a glyph system for self-perception and presentation.
- Drawing captures not only reality but possible futures.
- Visual editing (haircut, accessories, stance) is a form of identity spellwork.
- Sketching a stranger is a psychological handshake.

** Use-Cases
- Quick-read social profiling
- Designing disguises or alternate personas
- Strengthening observation + empathy
- Gifting art to form bonds or archive humanity
- Building expressive characters in writing or ops

** Fusion Combos
- With Psychology: Emotion decoding + microexpression anchoring
- With Ops/Security: Profiling for disguise or infiltration
- With Storytelling: Archetype + expression reference for characters
- With Org/Emacs: Build style databases and ritual logs

** Drawing Ritual Prompts
- Draw a stranger as they *want* to be seen.
- Draw yourself with the style of your future self.
- Sketch someone with the expression they’ve been hiding.
- Take one person, give them 3 visual timelines.
