#+TITLE: AeonCoreOS :: Nushell Integration for AeonShell

#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Introduction
This file outlines the integration of **Nushell** into **AeonCoreOS**, transforming it into a **security-first modular shell** (AeonShell). Nushell serves as the base shell for the system, and additional modules are layered on top to enhance security, auditing, and system protection. The shell will be extensible, flexible, and adaptable for various use cases.

* **Step 1**: Installing and Integrating Nushell

**1.1 Define Nushell Package in Guix**
- Install Nushell as a package in **Guix** with all dependencies. The package will ensure **Nushell** is available on **AeonCoreOS**.
  
```scheme
(define-public nushell
  (package
    (name "nushell")
    (version "0.76.0")
    (source (origin
              (method url-fetch)
              (uri (string-append "https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/download/" version "/nushell-" version "-x86_64-linux.tar.gz"))
              (sha256 (base32 "sha256-hash-of-the-release-tarball"))))
    (build-system gnu-build-system)
    (inputs
     `(("rust" ,rust)))
    (home-page "https://github.com/nushell/nushell")
    (synopsis "A modern shell for the future")
    (description "Nushell is a modern shell that works with structured data, focusing on safety, power, and extensibility.")
    (license license:mit)))

1.2 Install Nushell

After defining the package, use guix package to install Nushell on AeonCoreOS.

Test installation by running nushell --version from the terminal.


Step 2: Shell Core Modifications


2.1 Security-First Enhancements for Nushell

Add features like sandboxing, audit trails, and role-based access control (RBAC) to commands within Nushell.


2.2 Example: Command Sandboxing

Implement a plugin to wrap commands in a sandbox (e.g., using Firejail or Bubblewrap).


// Example of a sandbox plugin in Nushell
pub fn sandbox_command(command: &str) {
    let sandboxed = std::process::Command::new("firejail")
        .arg(command)
        .spawn()
        .expect("Failed to execute command in sandbox");
    sandboxed.wait().expect("Command failed");
}

2.3 Example: Command Auditing

Capture and securely store every command executed, including input/output logs.


// Example of a logging function
pub fn log_command(command: &str) {
    let log = format!("Command Executed: {}\n", command);
    let encrypted_log = encrypt_log(log); // Implement your encryption here
    save_log_to_file(encrypted_log);
}

2.4 Example: Role-Based Profiles

Allow dynamic switching between admin, restricted, and stealth profiles within Nushell.


// Profile switcher in Nushell
pub fn switch_profile(profile: &str) {
    if profile == "admin" {
        // Provide full system access
    } else if profile == "restricted" {
        // Limit access to only safe commands
    } else {
        println!("Invalid profile.");
    }
}

Step 3: Integrating Nushell into Guix Services


3.1 Define Nushell Service in Guix

Create a Guix service that runs Nushell on system startup with the required configurations and integrations.


(define (nushell-service)
  "Service that initializes Nushell with AeonShell security features."
  (let ((shepherd-service
         (service nushell-service-type
                  (simple-service
                   'nushell
                   (lambda _ (exec "/usr/bin/nushell" "--enable-modules" "aeon-shell")))))
    shepherd-service))

(define %nushell-service-type
  (service-type
   (name 'nushell)
   (extensions (list (service-constructor nushell-service)))
   (default-value '())))

3.2 Add Nushell Service to the System

Integrate the Nushell service into AeonCoreOS by adding it to the system services in the configuration.


(define (add-nushell-to-system system)
  "Add the Nushell service with AeonShell security integration."
  (operating-system
   (name (operating-system-name system))
   (host-name (operating-system-host-name system))
   (services (append
              (operating-system-services system)
              (list (nushell-service)))))

Step 4: Custom Nushell Plugins/Modules for Security


4.1 aeon-sandbox (Sandboxing Commands)

A Nushell plugin to wrap commands in a sandboxed environment for isolation (e.g., Firejail or Bubblewrap).


4.2 aeon-audit (Command Auditing and Logging)

A module that securely logs all commands, encrypts them, and stores them in a log file.


4.3 aeon-profile-switcher (Dynamic Profile Switching)

A module to switch between different security profiles (admin, restricted, stealth) based on user roles or environment.


4.4 Other Possible Plugins

aeon-honeypot: Deploy a honeypot to attract malicious actors.

aeon-watcher: Watch file system or network activities for suspicious behavior.


Step 5: Final Integration and Testing


5.1 Test Integration

Test the integration by verifying that the sandbox, auditing, and profile-switching features are working as expected.


5.2 Refining the Modules

Continue to improve the modular shell architecture, and integrate more features like AI-based anomaly detection, end-to-end encryption for logs, and more.


Conclusion By building on top of Nushell, AeonShell can leverage modern features such as structured pipelines and extensibility while adding robust security, privacy, and modularity layers. This shell will act as both a defensive and offensive tool for AeonCoreOS, empowering users to navigate and control their system with confidence.
