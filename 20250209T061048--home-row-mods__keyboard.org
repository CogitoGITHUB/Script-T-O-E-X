Switch to DVORACK !!!!!!

* Introduction
Home row mods are a powerful technique for improving keyboard efficiency by assigning modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, etc.) to the home row instead of using pinky-intensive keypresses. This improves ergonomics, reduces finger strain, and increases typing speed.

This document also explores whether switching to the Dvorak layout is worth it over QWERTY.

* Why Home Row Mods Matter
**1. Reduced Finger Strain**
   - Standard keyboards require frequent pinky movement for modifiers.
   - Home row mods keep modifiers under stronger fingers, reducing fatigue.

**2. Faster Key Combinations**
   - Pressing =Ctrl=, =Alt=, and =Shift= with thumbs or stronger fingers speeds up Emacs workflows.
   - Combos like =C-x C-f= become effortless.

**3. Better Ergonomics**
   - Reduces ulnar deviation (pinky strain).
   - Minimizes wrist movement.

**4. Works Well with Layered Keyboards**
   - Home row mods can be combined with layer switching.
   - Example: Holding =A= as =Ctrl= while pressing =S= for =C-s= search.

* Home Row Mods Implementation
- **Kanata (Linux, Windows, macOS)**
- **KMonad (Cross-platform, simple)**
- **QMK/VIA (For mechanical keyboards with firmware support)**

* Should You Use Dvorak Instead of QWERTY?
**Pros of Dvorak**
   - Optimized for English typing efficiency.
   - Keeps most common letters on the home row.
   - Reduces finger travel compared to QWERTY.

**Cons of Dvorak**
   - Requires retraining muscle memory.
   - QWERTY is standard in software development and security.
   - Emacs keybindings are designed for QWERTY.

**Alternative: Colemak**
   - Similar efficiency to Dvorak but retains many QWERTY shortcuts.
   - Easier transition for programmers.

* Final Recommendation
1. **Use home row mods, regardless of layout.**
2. **Stick to QWERTY if you work with multiple systems.**
3. **Try Colemak if you want an optimized layout with minimal retraining.**
4. **Only switch to Dvorak if you type a lot in English and can afford to retrain.**

* Conclusion
Home row mods provide immediate ergonomic benefits and should be implemented first. Keyboard layout changes are secondary and should only be considered if you have the time to adapt.
