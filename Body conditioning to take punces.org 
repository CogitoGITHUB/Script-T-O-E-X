* Introduction
Conditioning your body to take punches is essential for combat sports. The exercises below will help toughen your body and prepare you for impact. This is designed for solo training.

* Abdominal Conditioning
** Medicine Ball Drops
- Lie on your back and drop a moderately weighted medicine ball onto your abs.
- Start with a lighter ball and gradually increase the weight as your core strengthens.
- Alternative: Throw the ball into your abdomen while sitting or standing.

** Self-Tapping
- Use your hands to lightly tap your torso.
- Gradually increase the force of the taps to simulate punches.
- Focus on your abs, chest, and ribs.

* Body Striking
** Progressive Slapping
- Start by lightly slapping your torso, focusing on the abs.
- Gradually increase the intensity of the slaps to desensitize the muscles and skin.

** Foam Roller
- Use a foam roller and roll it over your torso, pressing harder over time.
- This helps to stimulate deep tissue and toughen the muscles.

* Core Strengthening
** Planks
- Hold plank positions for as long as possible (front and side planks).
- This builds core strength, which helps absorb punches.

** Leg Raises & Crunches
- Perform variations of leg raises and crunches to strengthen your abs.
- Sets: 3 sets of 15-20 reps.

** Russian Twists
- This exercise strengthens the oblique muscles.
- Use a medicine ball or weighted object for added resistance.

* Breathing Technique
- Practice exhaling forcefully at the moment of simulated impact.
- Imagine an incoming punch and exhale as if bracing for it during shadowboxing.

* Impact with Objects
** Punching Bag Pressure
- Press your torso against a heavy punching bag using your body weight.
- This simulates the resistance of being struck.

** Resistance Bands
- Attach resistance bands to a sturdy object and stretch them across your torso.
- This simulates the tension and force of a punch.

* Gradual Sensitization
- Start light and gradually increase the intensity of all exercises.
- Be cautious not to overdo it and allow your body to adapt over time.

* Stretching and Flexibility
- Regularly stretch, particularly focusing on your core and torso.
- Stretching helps with muscle elasticity and impact absorption, reducing injury risk.

* Notes
- Conditioning takes time, so ensure you're progressing gradually.
- Always allow time for recovery between sessions to avoid overtraining.
