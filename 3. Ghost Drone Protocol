* Mission Directive

Design a globally-operable, undetectable, modular ghost drone network powered by *AeonCoreOS*. The system deploys **remote phones as terminal nodes**, controlled by AeonCoreOS through **SSH**, **SMS**, or **LoRa triggers**. Once missions are complete, physical devices can be destroyed, hidden, or wiped.

The brain remains hidden—*AeonCoreOS* is the architect, the conductor, and the only intelligence that remembers the symphony.

* AeonCoreOS Philosophy

- **You are invisible.** The phone is just a tool, a hand with no fingerprints.
- **You command remotely.** All intelligence, processing, and decision-making lives in your AeonCoreOS node.
- **You operate asynchronously.** Nodes can be dormant for months, activated by obscure triggers.
- **You are replaceable.** Nodes die, the brain survives.

* System Architecture

**Primary Actor:**
- AeonCoreOS — the mastermind.

**Supporting Cast:**
- Burner phones (running minimal OS or Termux shell).
- Drones (carrying phones or relays).
- Mesh Nodes (phones in fixed locations—“ghost seeds”).
- Echo Repeaters (temporary Bluetooth/Wi-Fi relays).
- LoRa Modules (Meshtastic/DIY custom payload devices).

* Node Roles

**1. Primary Relay Drone (PRD)**
- Mission-critical operations (data injection/exfil, real-time ops).
- High-bandwidth (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi).
- Controlled over SSH from AeonCoreOS.

**2. Echo Relays**
- Minimal logic. Just forwards data in/out.
- Self-wipes if tampered or idle too long.
- Great for mesh hops or city-wide relays.

**3. Ghost Seeds**
- Hidden phones in secure urban/rural places.
- Only wake up when:
  - Receiving specific SMS (pre-shared encrypted keyword).
  - Time-based cronjob (weekly check-in).
  - GPS/geofence activation.
- Perfect for OSINT-timed missions (use your recon to choose where and when to plant them).

* Activation Examples

**Encrypted SMS Wakeup:**
```bash
on_sms_receive() {
  [[ "$SMS" == "$(decrypt_key 'DRACO AWAKEN')" ]] && start_ssh && notify_aeoncore
}
