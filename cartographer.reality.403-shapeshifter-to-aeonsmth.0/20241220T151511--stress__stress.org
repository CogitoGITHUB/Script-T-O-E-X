* About Stress

For too long, we've been told to manage stress, but I'm not thrilled with how that's working out for any of us in terms of our health and quality of life. Instead, I want to understand what leads an individual to produce stress hormones in the first place and then help them produce fewer of them. When it comes to health, I look at everything through three lenses: nutrition, biochemistry, and emotions.

Relentless stress hormone production disrupts many functions inside us, from nutrient absorption and digestion to sleep quality, sex hormone balance, immunity, thyroid function, energy, resilience, and even our self-talk and interactions with others. The ripple effects of stress are significant.

It's important to acknowledge that there is genuine stress going on in the world and in people's lives right now. However, there's also a significant amount of stress we create for ourselves because of how we think, and that's the part I'm interested in because that's the part we can change.

We often believe that stress comes from everything outside of us, from people or situations. But what we've lost sight of is that it's actually our response to those people or situations that determines whether something is stressful or not.

For example, consider a pile of dirty dishes in the kitchen. Some days, you may simply walk past them and think, "I just hope an angel will turn up and sort them out for me." But on other days, when you see the same pile of dirty dishes, you may think, "My entire life is falling apart." The dishes are the same, but our response to them can be vastly different from day to day.

To understand why we react this way, we need to consider human evolution. Our world has rapidly changed over the last 75 years, which I refer to as the commercial era. During this time, we've seen significant changes in technology, lifestyle, and societal norms. However, in the context of the 150,000 years humans have been on the planet, the last 75 years represent only a tiny fraction of that time.

Our stress response system has evolved over millions of years to deal with physical threats to our survival, such as predators or other dangers. However, in modern times, we often trigger the same stress response system in situations that are not life-threatening, such as work deadlines or social interactions.

In modern times, we produce adrenaline not only in response to physical threats but also in response to perceived pressure, urgency, or disapproval from others. Our body hasn't yet learned to distinguish between the adrenaline we produce in response to physical threats and the adrenaline we produce in response to everyday stressors.

It's time to communicate the truth to our bodies, which is that we are relatively safe. We can do this by exploring our "forehead words," which are the traits we need others to see in us. Take a moment to ask yourself, "How do I need others to see me?" There's no right or wrong answer; it's just what is unique to you.

Some common "forehead words" people share include kind, thoughtful, selfless, efficient, reliable, hardworking, perfect, creative, strong, intelligent, or the biggest ray of sunshine in the room. Once you identify your "forehead words," pay attention to whether your stress is triggered by a perceived disapproval from others that contradicts these traits.

We often create stress for ourselves by seeking approval or avoiding disapproval from others. This can lead to a constant escalation of stress hormones in our bodies, affecting our physical and emotional well-being.

To break this cycle of stress, we need to train our new brain, which has the ability to apply reason and logic. Our new brain can help us reevaluate our automatic responses generated by our old brain and choose more adaptive responses to stressors.

Ultimately, the opposite of stress is trust. We need to trust in the unfolding of life's journey and learn to respond to challenges with grace and resilience. By understanding the origins of our stress and learning to navigate our thoughts and emotions more effectively, we can reduce the impact of stress on our health and quality of life.

Our journey towards greater well-being begins with recognizing the power of our minds to shape our experiences and cultivating trust in the process of life itself.
