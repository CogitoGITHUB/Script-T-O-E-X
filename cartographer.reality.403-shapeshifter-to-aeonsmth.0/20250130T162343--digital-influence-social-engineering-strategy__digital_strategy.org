#+STARTUP: indent overview

* Overview
  - This file is a **strategic playbook** for:
    - Digital persuasion, propaganda, and influence operations.
    - OSINT & social engineering tactics.
    - AI-driven content manipulation.
    - Psychological operations (PsyOps) in online spaces.
  - Focus: **Control narratives, engineer behavior, and influence thought patterns.**

* TODO Research Areas
** TODO Digital Psychological Warfare & Narrative Control
   - [ ] Study *The Psychology of Mass Persuasion* (Bernays, Le Bon)
   - [ ] Analyze government & corporate PsyOps (declassified docs)
   - [ ] Research NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) for digital influence
   - [ ] Examine **cognitive biases** in social media (reciprocity, scarcity, social proof)
   - [ ] Track real-world **information warfare campaigns** (Ukraine, China, Russia)

** TODO Social Engineering & OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
   - [ ] Study *Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking* – Christopher Hadnagy
   - [ ] Research OSINT tools (Maltego, SpiderFoot, Shodan, FOCA)
   - [ ] Learn pretexting & online deception techniques
   - [ ] Develop a strategy for persona creation & sock puppet accounts
   - [ ] Map digital footprint tracking & identity obfuscation

** TODO Algorithmic Manipulation & AI Influence
   - [ ] Study **algorithm biases** in YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Facebook
   - [ ] Research **AI-driven engagement farming** (bots, auto-responders)
   - [ ] Experiment with **automated influence campaigns**
   - [ ] Understand **predictive behavior modeling** (Cambridge Analytica case)
   - [ ] Learn AI-generated persuasion techniques (GPT-based psychological influence)

** TODO Meme Warfare & Viral Content Engineering
   - [ ] Study *Memetics: The Science of Thought Contagion*
   - [ ] Research **successful viral campaigns** (Trump 2016, QAnon, political memes)
   - [ ] Analyze **how humor is weaponized** in propaganda
   - [ ] Develop a **meme strategy** for digital influence
   - [ ] Study **framing & priming techniques** for online discourse

** TODO Digital Reputation Management & Anonymity
   - [ ] Research **doxxing & counter-doxxing techniques**
   - [ ] Study **online identity compartmentalization** (Sock Puppets & Personas)
   - [ ] Learn about **censorship evasion strategies** (dark patterns, coded language)
   - [ ] Investigate **deepfake & synthetic identity creation**
   - [ ] Develop a **self-erasure & obfuscation strategy** for online operations

* Notes & Analysis
  - Store findings & strategic observations here.
  - Example:
    - *Bernays' Propaganda*: "Control of the masses is best done by invisible hands."
    - *AI-Generated Persuasion*: "Chatbot interactions shape opinion faster than traditional ads."
    - *Meme Warfare*: "Repetition & humor are primary accelerators of viral influence."
