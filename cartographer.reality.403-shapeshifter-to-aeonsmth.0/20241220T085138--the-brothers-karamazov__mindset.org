* Dostoevsky's Teaching in "The Brothers Karamazov"

** Quote:
   "Remember especially that you cannot be the judge of anyone.
   For there can be no judge of a criminal on earth until the judge knows that he, too,
   is a criminal, exactly the same as the one who stands before him, and that he is perhaps
   most guilty of all for the crime of the one standing before him. When he understands this,
   then he will be able to be a judge. However mad that may seem, it is true. For if I myself
   were righteous, perhaps there would be no criminal standing before me now.
   If you are able to take upon yourself the crime of the criminal who stands before you
   and whom you are judging in your heart, do so at once, and suffer for him yourself, and
   let him go without reproach."

** Explanation:
   Dostoevsky's character highlights that by freeing your mind from judgment, you can contribute
   to creating a better world. This is because a mind free of judgment is capable of endless learning,
   which is essential for correcting mistakes and improving oneself.

** How a Mind Free of Judgment Leads to a Better World:

   - **Correction through Learning:**
     The key to creating a better world is correction, which requires the ability to correct mistakes.
     Learning occurs through prediction and correction. A mind free of judgment is naturally predictive
     and open to correction, facilitating endless learning.

   - **Dropping the Desire for Certainty:**
     To free the mind from judgment, one must drop the desire for certainty. Certainty leads to delusion
     and stops the process of learning. Embracing uncertainty allows for continuous growth and improvement.

   - **Difference Between Judgmental and Predictive Minds:**
     Candace, with a judgmental mind, dismisses Thomas without giving him a chance. Lucy, with a predictive
     mind, tests her prediction by reading Thomas's work. She corrects her initial judgment and discovers
     Thomas's talent, leading to his success.

** Conclusion:**
   Dostoevsky's teaching emphasizes the importance of freeing the mind from judgment to foster learning,
   correction, and ultimately, the creation of a better world. By embracing uncertainty and continuous
   improvement, individuals can contribute positively to society.
