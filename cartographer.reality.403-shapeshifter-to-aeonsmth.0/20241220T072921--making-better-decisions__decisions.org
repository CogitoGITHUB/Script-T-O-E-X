* Making Better Decisions: Understanding Time and Other Key Factors

  To explain how to make better decisions, let us first look at "Dark," a German time-travel science-fiction drama on Netflix. The show dips in and out of multiple timelines, showing characters interacting with different versions of themselves and their loved ones. The characters are constantly making decisions with massive consequences in the present day and in all other timelines. There's one quote that stands out the most. One of the main characters, Jonas, is speaking to Marta:

  - "Why do we say that?” 
  - “To have time.” 
  - “How can you have time when it clearly has you?"

  Time does control us - we're simply along for the ride. But that doesn't mean our journey is without aim. When making better decisions, utilizing your time is perhaps your most effective tool. 

** Understanding Time in Decision Making

  - Rushed decisions often lead to regrets. Take the time to consider your options thoroughly.
  - Understanding time's place in your decision-making process is vital to becoming a better decision-maker.

** Other Benefits of Good Decision Makers

  - Making better decisions saves time and provides more options and flexibility.
  - Learning from past errors is a critical aspect of personal development.
  - Good decision-making contributes to a better work-life balance and can lead to greater life satisfaction.

** Utilizing Silence and Reflection

  - Embrace moments of silence to think before making decisions.
  - Allocate time for post-decision reflection to understand why certain decisions were made and how to improve in the future.

** Understanding Mental Heuristics

  - Mental heuristics are shortcuts used to solve problems quickly and effectively.
  - Recognize and understand your mental heuristics to avoid cognitive biases and make better decisions.

** Identifying Unknowns and Values

  - Recognize what you don't know to identify areas for improvement.
  - Know your values and align your decisions accordingly to make better choices.
