* Kinetotherapy Map: Foundational Overview
  - This map covers broad areas such as **joint mobility**, **muscle activation**, **posture correction**, and **functional strengthening**.
  - Adjust and specialize as necessary based on specific needs and progress.

* TODO Joint Mobility & Flexibility
** TODO Neck & Upper Spine Mobility
   - [ ] **Cervical rotations** (left and right)
   - [ ] **Neck tilts** (side to side)
   - [ ] **Thoracic spine twists**
   - [ ] **Chin tucks** for neck stability and alignment

** TODO Shoulder & Upper Body Mobility
   - [ ] **Shoulder circles** (forward and backward)
   - [ ] **Wall slides** (shoulder mobility)
   - [ ] **Scapular retractions** (to improve shoulder posture)
   - [ ] **External/internal rotations** with resistance bands

** TODO Elbow & Wrist Mobility
   - [ ] **Wrist stretches** (flexion, extension, and rotations)
   - [ ] **Elbow extensions** and flexions
   - [ ] **Wrist rotations** with light resistance or bodyweight
   - [ ] **Forearm stretches** (flexor and extensor stretches)

** TODO Hip & Lower Spine Mobility
   - [ ] **Hip circles** (internal and external rotation)
   - [ ] **Cat-Cow stretches** (for spinal flexibility)
   - [ ] **Pelvic tilts** (for lower back mobility)
   - [ ] **Deep squats** (assisted, with focus on depth)

** TODO Knee & Ankle Mobility
   - [ ] **Knee extensions/flexions**
   - [ ] **Ankle rotations** (inward, outward, and circles)
   - [ ] **Calf stretches** (for ankle flexibility)
   - [ ] **Hip flexor stretches** (lunge variations)

* TODO Muscle Activation & Strengthening
** TODO Core Activation
   - [ ] **Plank variations** (front, side planks)
   - [ ] **Dead bugs** (core stabilization)
   - [ ] **Bridges** (glute and core activation)
   - [ ] **Bird-Dog** (balance and core stabilization)

** TODO Glute & Hip Strengthening
   - [ ] **Clamshells** (with resistance band)
   - [ ] **Glute bridges** (single leg variations)
   - [ ] **Lunges** (forward, reverse, lateral)
   - [ ] **Hip abduction/adduction** (lying or standing)

** TODO Knee Stabilization
   - [ ] **Quad sets** (activation without movement)
   - [ ] **Hamstring curls** (with a ball or machine)
   - [ ] **Step-ups** (onto a raised platform)
   - [ ] **Terminal knee extensions** (resistance band focus)

** TODO Upper Body Activation
   - [ ] **Shoulder press** (light weight, bodyweight variations)
   - [ ] **Push-ups** (modified if necessary, progressive overload)
   - [ ] **Lat pull-downs** (focus on scapular depression)
   - [ ] **Bicep curls** (controlled tempo, light resistance)

* TODO Posture Correction & Alignment
** TODO Spinal Alignment
   - [ ] **Chin tucks** (improving cervical posture)
   - [ ] **Thoracic extensions** (foam rolling or supported)
   - [ ] **Cat-Cow stretches** (mobilizing thoracic spine)
   - [ ] **Seated rows** (to improve posture and scapular retraction)

** TODO Pelvic Alignment
   - [ ] **Pelvic tilts** (lying or standing)
   - [ ] **Glute bridges** (to activate posterior chain)
   - [ ] **Hip flexor stretches** (to relieve anterior pelvic tilt)
   - [ ] **Abdominal strengthening** (to stabilize the pelvis)

** TODO Shoulder Alignment
   - [ ] **Wall angels** (correcting shoulder mobility and posture)
   - [ ] **External rotation with resistance bands** (focus on rotator cuff)
   - [ ] **Scapular push-ups** (to activate upper back muscles)
   - [ ] **Chest openers** (stretching pectorals to release tightness)

* TODO Functional Strengthening & Recovery
** TODO Low-Impact Full Body Movements
   - [ ] **Squats** (assisted or air squats for functional movement)
   - [ ] **Lunges** (forward, reverse, lateral variations)
   - [ ] **Hip hinges** (good morning, deadlifts with bodyweight)
   - [ ] **Step-ups** (using a platform or low box)

** TODO Balance & Stability Training
   - [ ] **Single-leg balance** (static or dynamic)
   - [ ] **Standing on an unstable surface** (balance board or BOSU)
   - [ ] **Standing leg lifts** (front, side, and rear)
   - [ ] **Resistance band walking** (side steps to activate glutes)

** TODO Full-Body Mobility Drills
   - [ ] **Bear crawl** (engages full body mobility)
   - [ ] **Inchworms** (mobilizes hamstrings, glutes, and shoulders)
   - [ ] **Leg swings** (front-to-back and side-to-side)
   - [ ] **World’s greatest stretch** (full body mobility flow)

* TODO Recovery & Stretching
** TODO Active Stretching
   - [ ] **Dynamic hip flexor stretches** (lunge variations)
   - [ ] **Dynamic hamstring stretches** (leg swings or walking lunges)
   - [ ] **Arm circles** (for shoulder mobility)
   - [ ] **Lateral lunges** (improve inner thigh flexibility)

** TODO Passive Stretching
   - [ ] **Hamstring stretch** (seated or lying)
   - [ ] **Quadriceps stretch** (standing or prone)
   - [ ] **Hip flexor stretch** (lunges, kneeling variations)
