* 12 Cognitive Biases Explained

  In this video, we'll explore 12 cognitive biases that influence our decision-making process:

  1. **Anchoring Bias**
     - People rely heavily on the first piece of information they receive when making decisions. This can significantly influence subsequent judgments.

  2. **Availability Heuristic Bias**
     - Overestimating the importance of information readily available to us, such as news headlines, leading to skewed perceptions of reality.

  3. **Bandwagon Effect**
     - The tendency to follow the crowd or conform to popular opinions without critical thinking.

  4. **Choice-Supportive Bias**
     - Defending our choices even when they may not be the best, simply because we made them.

  5. **Confirmation Bias**
     - Seeking out information that confirms our existing beliefs and ignoring contradictory evidence.

  6. **Ostrich Bias**
     - Ignoring negative information or problems in the hope that they will go away on their own.

  7. **Outcome Bias**
     - Judging the effectiveness of a decision based solely on its outcome, rather than considering the circumstances at the time the decision was made.

  8. **Overconfidence**
     - Being overly confident in our abilities or judgments, often leading to poor decision-making.

  9. **Placebo Bias**
     - Believing in the effectiveness of something (e.g., medication) solely because we expect it to work, even if it has no real impact.

  10. **Survivorship Bias**
      - Focusing only on successful outcomes and overlooking failures, leading to skewed perceptions of success.

  11. **Selective Perception**
      - Perceiving messages and actions according to our existing beliefs, often ignoring contradictory information.

  12. **Blind Spot Bias**
      - Underestimating our own biases while overestimating the biases of others, leading to a false sense of objectivity.

  These biases can significantly impact our decision-making process and lead to irrational behavior. By understanding them, we can become more aware of our thought patterns and make more informed choices.
