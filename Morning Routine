* Journaling: A Tool for Deep Thinking and Reflection*

**Introduction**
   Journaling serves as a powerful tool for collecting thoughts, reflecting on them, and sharpening one's thinking. This video explores how to journal like a philosopher, distinguishing journaling from keeping a diary or commonplace book and highlighting three key features for thinking deeply.

**Distinguishing Types of Notebooks**
   - **Diary**: Records daily experiences and emotions, often personal and time-bound.
   - **Journal**: Captures thoughts and ideas, facilitates metacognition and reflection.
   - **Commonplace Book**: Collects quotes and reflections, serving as a reservoir of wisdom.
   - **Compendium**: Systematically gathers information, like an encyclopedia.
   - **Book of Soliloquies**: Engages in self-dialogue, exploring thoughts and emotions.
   - **Pocket Notebook**: Serves as a catch-all for ideas and to-do lists, aiding daily organization.

**Thinking Like a Philosopher: Three Key Features**
   - **Clarity**: Clearly articulate ideas and definitions to ensure understanding.
   - **Argumentation**: Provide reasoned arguments to support positions and assertions.
   - **Anticipation and Addressing of Objections**: Anticipate counterarguments and objections, and address them to strengthen arguments.

**Applying Philosophical Thinking to Journaling**
   Keeping a deep thinking philosophy journal involves:
   1. **Choosing a Fascinating Idea**: Select a topic that intrigues and generates further thoughts.
   2. **Clarity and Definition**: Define terms and concepts clearly to avoid ambiguity.
   3. **Argumentation**: Provide arguments to support positions and assertions, drawing from relevant literature.
   4. **Anticipation of Objections**: Consider potential counterarguments and objections, and address them to strengthen arguments.
   5. **Reflection and Iteration**: Reflect on ideas, refine arguments, and iterate on them through deep thinking sessions.

**Conclusion**
   Journaling serves as a valuable practice for deep thinking and reflection, particularly when approached with the rigor and clarity of philosophical inquiry. By incorporating the key features of philosophical thinking—clarity, argumentation, and anticipation of objections—journaling can become a transformative tool for enhancing one's thinking and understanding.

* My Reading Journal: A Practice of Intellectual Autobiography

  ** Introduction
     - For the past five years, I have maintained a journal specifically for recording every book I read. This journal serves as a dedicated space to catalog my reading journey.
     - Unlike a commonplace book where I jot down thoughts, reflections, and quotes about what I'm reading, this journal is solely a list of books and authors. It's a straightforward record of the books I've completed, devoid of any commentary.
     - This practice serves as an intellectual autobiography, reflecting my evolving interests and reading habits over time. It provides a tangible record of my literary journey, allowing me to trace the trajectory of my reading tastes and preferences.

  ** Tracking Progress
     - In 2018, I managed to read 45 books despite the demands of graduate school. This number is not surprising given the academic nature of my studies at the time, which primarily involved reading scholarly articles and research papers.
     - Despite being busy finishing my dissertation and getting married in 2019, I prioritized my reading habit and managed to read 60 books. This increase in the number of books read reflects my commitment to carving out time for personal enrichment amidst life's significant milestones.
     - The lockdowns and social distancing measures in 2020 provided ample opportunities for reading, resulting in a significant uptick in my reading activity. I devoured 72 books during this time, taking advantage of the extra hours spent at home.
     - In 2021, I reached a peak with 76 books read, marking it as my best reading year yet. This accomplishment was a testament to my dedication to the pursuit of knowledge and intellectual growth.
     - In 2022, I set a more modest goal of reading 52 books. While this number may seem lower than previous years, it represents a deliberate choice to prioritize quality over quantity. By aiming for a book a week, I can devote more time and attention to each text, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation for the material.

  ** Quality Over Quantity
     - I've found that reading about 52 books a year allows me to read better rather than just reading more. This slower pace enables me to engage more deeply with each text, savoring the richness of the content and exploring its nuances.
     - Reading better involves more than just speed-reading through a stack of books; it requires active participation, critical thinking, and reflection. By slowing down and immersing myself in the material, I can extract more value from each reading experience.
     - The toxic productivity culture prevalent in today's society often promotes the idea of reading more books as a measure of success. However, true fulfillment and growth come from the quality of our reading, not the quantity. It's essential to resist the temptation to prioritize volume over depth and to cultivate a mindful approach to reading.

  ** Mindful Reading
     - Reading should be a mindful practice, akin to physical exercise. Just as over-exercising can lead to burnout and injury, binge-reading can result in superficial engagement with texts and a lack of comprehension.
     - It's crucial to slow down, savor the reading experience, and allow time for reflection and understanding. By approaching each book with intention and curiosity, we can derive greater meaning and insight from the material.
     - Treating books as old friends, revisiting them, and engaging in discussions with fellow readers can deepen our relationship with literature and enhance our appreciation for the written word.
     - Let the number of books read be a reflection of your journey rather than the goal itself. By prioritizing quality over quantity and fostering a community of like-minded readers, we can derive more fulfillment and enrichment from our reading practice.

  ** Conclusion
     - Instead of focusing on reading more books, prioritize reading better. Choose books wisely, engage deeply with them, and foster a community of like-minded readers.
     - Let the number of books read be a reflection of your journey rather than the goal itself. By prioritizing quality over quantity and fostering a community of like-minded readers, we can derive more fulfillment and enrichment from our reading practice.

* Living Like You're Dying

  A friend once replied with "live like you're dying" after I joked about moving to Portugal amidst a conversation about work stress. While we laughed it off, that line lingered in my mind, prompting me to ponder its true meaning.

  ** Questioning the Meaning:
     When we hear such statements, thrilling experiences flood our minds, like running a marathon or learning a new language. But do these experiences truly bring peace on our deathbeds? Beneath our glamorized understanding lies pragmatic questions seldom asked until circumstances force us to confront them.

  ** Facing Mortality:
     Imagine waking with a minor headache, later diagnosed as a terminal brain tumor. How would such news alter your perception of life's meaning? What if you had only a few years, months, or even weeks left? These intense questions, though uncomfortable, unveil universal lessons.

  ** Palliative Care Insights:
     Palliative care nurses, like Ronnie Ware, gleaned insights from patients' end-of-life regrets, highlighting themes of happiness, relationships, self-expression, and work-life balance. Surprisingly, many wished they hadn't worked so hard, a poignant irony in our quest for meaning through careers.

  ** Reevaluating Work:
     While some, like neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi, find profound meaning in their careers, many toil in unfulfilling jobs. Balancing economic stability and personal fulfillment proves elusive. Yet, Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard suggests finding meaning within, regardless of profession.

  ** Confronting Mortality:
     Terror management theory posits that awareness of mortality drives behaviors, from nationalism to racism. Yet, individuals like Claire Wineland, facing terminal illness, find profound meaning despite adversity. Their stories challenge us to confront mortality and live authentically.

  ** Embracing Truth:
     Audre Lorde, reflecting on her battle with cancer, emphasized the importance of living authentically and speaking truthfully. As we navigate life's chaos, prioritizing what truly matters becomes paramount, ensuring a life lived with purpose and fulfillment.

  ** Final Reflections:
     In our final moments, amidst snippets of memory, we confront life's essence. While not everyone suffers a terminal illness, all face mortality. Reflect on whether you'd be content if that moment arrived today. If not, it's time to live like you're dying.

* Habits for Mental Clarity
  Here are 7 habits that may help boost your Mental Clarity:

1. Clear Your Mind:
   Engage in regular mental house cleaning. Consider doing a brain dump by writing in a journal to pour out extra thoughts and emotions. Use a calendar to track important dates and appointments, freeing your mind from constant reminders.

2. Take Regular Breaks:
   Give your brain a rest by taking regular breaks throughout the day. Avoid constant input to prevent mental exhaustion. Prioritize sleep to refresh your brain's waste clearance system and improve cognitive function.

3. Daily Meditation:
   Practice meditation to cultivate calmness, peace, and balance. Start with short sessions and gradually increase duration. Focus on your breath and let go of busy thoughts to enhance mindfulness and reduce stress.

4. Focus on What Matters:
   Prioritize tasks to avoid fragmented thinking. Write down your to-do list and batch tasks into manageable groups. Address the most important tasks first and work on them one at a time.

5. Take a Walk:
   Boost mental clarity by increasing blood flow through physical activity. Walking stimulates the release of endorphins, which reduce stress and improve mood. Many great thinkers credited long walks with inspiration and problem-solving.

6. Watch What You’re Consuming:
   Be mindful of the foods and substances you consume as they affect cognitive function. Limit caffeine intake and focus on brain-healthy foods such as leafy greens, berries, walnuts, and fatty fish. Avoid excessive carbs and sugar, which can lead to mood swings and fatigue.

7. Declutter the Junk Mail:
   Empty your mental "junk mail" folder by letting go of irrelevant information and social trivia. Focus on what truly matters and reserve mental energy for meaningful tasks. Avoid getting caught up in drama and gossip to maintain mental clarity and reduce stress.

* Micro-Habits to Change Your Life
For many people, every New Year comes with the New Year’s Resolution. These usually take the shape of fairly life-changing goals, such as finding a new job or finally getting ripped for the summer. However, such a mindset is destined for failure. Sure, it’s a good idea to have overarching goals. They provide a sense of focus and a general direction to head towards. But it isn’t sustainable. Think about it, if you woke up every day telling yourself “I need to find a job”, the enormity of it all will weigh heavy. You can’t just find the perfect role with the click of your fingers. If anything, a constant reminder of your overarching goal will weigh you down. Big changes require small actions. More specifically, micro-habits. By implementing any of the seven micro-habits I’ll explain in this video, you put yourself in the best possible position to change your life in a positive way. With each small habit, you’re chipping away at your goals and dicing them up into smaller, more attainable pieces.
** Planning, Planning, Planning
When thinking about going on holiday, the planning is unlikely to be your first thought. Of course, you may love the planning process, but it’s easy to forget how crucial it is, not just for a stress-free trip but in every day life too. If you’re looking to change your life for the better, planning is something that can dramatically help. Let’s take your daily routine. One thing off-putting about exercise - particularly the gym - is the length of the process. Think about it, you need to get ready, travel, workout, go home, and then cook a meal. It’s not the quickest process in the world, but with a bit of simple planning, you can save yourself so much time and mental energy required to exercise in the first place. For example, you could get your bag and clothes ready the night before you leave (this helps when getting up early for anything). You can plan your workout from there, eliminating the headache of which machine to use. A more significant step is meal preparation - a valuable time-saving tactic for everyone. You could cook a batch of lunch meals for the week, helping your day move along swiftly without needing to stop and cook. A prominent part of changing your life is about maximizing your time. Planning gives you some back.
** Active Breaks
Even though the pandemic normalized remote working, a few similar elements carry over. For example, even though you’re not in an office, you’re likely at a laptop sitting in an office chair. To change your life, the difference lies in how you take a break. In an office setting, it’s perhaps tempting to go from sitting behind a computer at your desk to sitting in a break room looking at a phone. While you have more freedom at home, the comforts of a sofa and television are not far away. Instead, take an active break. This means changing your current state. If you’ve been sitting behind a screen, take a walk. Go and play with your dog, or perhaps a stretch. Changing your environment and state as much as you can paves the way for recharging. After all, we’re only human. We cannot work for 9 hours straight, and your body won’t properly realize it’s time for a break if you do a similar activity all the time. Recharging, even if it’s just for ten minutes, is a vital tool to have when trying to turn your life around.
** Get the Right Water Bottle
Of course, everyone knows the benefits of drinking more water. It keeps you alive, after all. That being said, it’s often a forgotten thing, as dehydration is unlikely to be at the top of your concerns when your mind is elsewhere. You could set reminders to drink water, but there’s a more you-friendly way. Think of your water bottle as your trusted companion. Sure, you may have friends or family, but a water bottle will go absolutely anywhere with you, always providing aid in a time of dehydrated need. The type of water bottle you have can dramatically change how you drink it. For example, bottles with straws in them are becoming incredibly popular because of how easy they are to use. By not needing to lift your head up and over, sipping water is something that will slowly become habit. After all, it’s the little things.
** Learn the Power of a Playlist
Music flows all around us. There’s a song for every mood. Whether you’re running Shrek-style through a field of flowers or setting the tone for a study session, music has an innate ability to draw emotion out from within. Organizing your music into specific playlists allows you to pick and choose the type of music you need instead of continuously searching for songs. Remember, changing your life is mainly about saving your time - time you can better use elsewhere.
** Daydreaming
What are micro-habits? It’s in the name. If the habit is too daunting to begin, you’re much less likely to persevere. That’s why micro-habits need to be as easy and accessible as possible. There’s perhaps nothing more simple than daydreaming. While kids may be told off for it at school, it can actually be a very powerful tool. You see, daydreaming isn’t wasted time. It’s thinking time. Take J.R.R Tolkein, author of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit series’. It’s claimed he thought of Middle Earth and everything else besides while daydreaming during a marking session as a university professor. J.K Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, imagined a bespeckled boy with a scar on his head while daydreaming on a train. Daydreaming may be forgettable most of the time, but it can lead to some beautiful ideas, which is great for creativity - a tool everyone should employ if they wish to change their lives.
** Ask Yourself One Question
There’s one phrase we’ve all likely heard: if you don’t ask, you don’t get. It’s so popular because it’s true. Asking in the first place can be difficult, however. Start by asking yourself a simple question: “What’s the worst that could happen?” In many instances, the worst is a “no.” I’m here to tell you that’s okay. The word “no” itself isn’t a bad thing. It’s the negativity surrounding it that does the damage. If the worst thing to happen in that scenario is being told “no”, then you have nothing to lose.
** Micro-Analyze Your Behavior
No one likes a micro-manager. That annoying presence constantly looming over your shoulder and picking at all your work is one many will relate to, but that’s not what this means. By micro-analyzing your behavior, you’re able to understand it with much more depth than otherwise. For example, let’s say you procrastinate more than you like. When you dig deeper, you might notice that you put off a task because you’re worried it may amount to nothing, so not doing it is a way of protecting yourself from any kind of rejection. By learning that, you can adjust. For instance, you may choose to split tasks up into smaller chunks to more easily feel like you’ve achieved something. The problem many have with micro-analyzing is the lens they see

* The Age of Bionic Augmentations

** Introduction
   - In the year 2122, humanity embraced mass-scale bionic body augmentations, marking a significant shift in societal norms.
   - Jack, a 29-year-old man, initially resisted the trend, clinging to his entirely organic body despite the pressure to upgrade.

** Jack's Transition
   - Jack's job as a physical laborer became increasingly challenging due to his biological limitations compared to his cyber-enhanced coworkers.
   - After years of deliberation, Jack finally opted for bionic replacements for his arms and legs in 2124.

** Assimilating Bionic Enhancements
   - Jack adapted to his new limbs relatively quickly, integrating them seamlessly into his daily life.
   - Over the years, as technology advanced, Jack underwent numerous additional augmentations, replacing various organs and eventually his entire skull and neck.

** The Rise of Bionic Culture
   - Society underwent a transformative shift, with bionic augmentations becoming the norm to stay competitive in the automated job market.
   - Bionic replacements promised improved strength, functionality, and longevity, as well as potential lifespan extension.

** The Brain Machine Interface Era
   - By 2146, implantable brain machine interfaces (BMIs) entered the consumer market, enabling direct interaction between the brain and external devices.
   - Initial resistance to recreational BMIs eventually waned as they became integral to daily life and work.

** Software Updates and Self-Identity
   - Users could download software updates to control personal desires, habits, and even memories, leading to alterations in self-identity.
   - Jack initially resisted major updates but eventually succumbed to societal pressure, altering memories and preferences to fit in.

** The Question of Identity
   - Despite radical physical and mental changes, Jack retained a sense of self-identity rooted in continuous memory of himself.
   - Optional questionnaires prompted Jack to reflect on his evolving identity over time, raising existential questions about self-perception.

** Conclusion
   - Jack's journey reflects the profound societal transformations brought about by bionic augmentations and technological advancements.
   - As humanity navigates the complexities of identity in the age of augmentation, the fundamental essence of self remains a timeless enigma.

* Importance of Morning Routines
  - Successful individuals often have structured morning routines aimed at promoting better health, productivity, and overall well-being.
  - Personalized morning routines are intentional and tailored to individual preferences, goals, and lifestyles.

** Creating a Morning Routine
  - Determine meaningful activities that align with your values, aspirations, and daily objectives.
  - Experiment with different components to find what works best for you.
  - Hal Elrod's S.A.V.E.R.S. method offers suggestions for components of a morning routine:
    + **S = Silence:** Meditation, deep breathing exercises, or mindful walks in nature can promote inner calm and mental clarity.
    + **A = Affirmations:** Start your day with positive affirmations to cultivate a mindset of gratitude, confidence, and resilience.
    + **V = Visualizations:** Envision your goals and aspirations in vivid detail, reinforcing your motivation and commitment to achieving them.
    + **E = Exercise:** Engage in physical activity that energizes your body and boosts your mood, whether it's yoga, jogging, or a brisk walk.
    + **R = Reading:** Stimulate your mind with inspiring or educational material, such as books, articles, or motivational quotes.
    + **S = Scribing:** Reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and goals through journaling or creative writing, fostering self-awareness and personal growth.

** Minimizing Decisions
  - Decision fatigue can drain mental energy and hinder productivity, so streamline your morning routine by minimizing unnecessary choices.
  - Plan and prepare as much as possible the night before, such as selecting your outfit, preparing breakfast ingredients, and organizing your workspace.
  - Consider adopting a minimalist approach to your possessions and environment to reduce clutter and simplify decision-making.

** Maintaining the Routine
  - Consistency is key to reaping the benefits of a morning routine, so commit to practicing it daily, even on weekends or holidays.
  - Start with a manageable routine and gradually add or adjust components as needed to suit your evolving needs and priorities.
  - Stay motivated by setting goals, tracking your progress, and rewarding yourself for sticking to your routine.

** Flexibility
  - Be open to adapting your morning routine based on changes in your schedule, responsibilities, or interests.
  - Experiment with new activities or techniques to keep your routine fresh and engaging.
  - Remember that the ultimate goal is to enhance your overall well-being and effectiveness, so don't hesitate to modify your routine as necessary to achieve that objective.

* Increasing pain tolerance can be a gradual process that involves both physical and mental conditioning.
Here's a routine that can help you gradually build your pain tolerance:
Pain Tolerance Increasing Routine:
1. Start Slowly: Begin with manageable discomfort or pain levels and gradually increase intensity over time. Pushing too hard too quickly can lead to injuries or burnout.
2. Physical Conditioning:   - Strength Training: Engage in resistance exercises to build overall strength and endurance.   - Cardiovascular Exercise: Perform aerobic activities such as running, swimming, or cycling to improve cardiovascular fitness.   - Flexibility and Mobility: Incorporate stretching exercises and yoga to improve flexibility and joint mobility.
3. Incremental Exposure:   - Gradual Intensity Increase: Slowly expose yourself to higher levels of discomfort or pain during workouts or physical activities.   - Controlled Discomfort: Practice activities that challenge your pain threshold, such as cold showers or exposure to uncomfortable temperatures.
