* Introduction
Origami and medicine might seem worlds apart, but both demand precision, spatial awareness, and creativity.
This module explores the fusion of folding techniques with medical tools for practical, tactical, and training purposes.

* Objectives
- Explore the use of folding techniques in medical tool design.
- Design training exercises using origami and surgical tools.
- Develop deployable medical gear based on origami principles.
- Map metaphorical applications into Guix/Emacs environments.

* Toolset
** Surgical Instruments
- Forceps (for folding manipulation)
- Hemostats (locking clamps as “origami clips”)
- Scalpel (for precision shaping)
- Sterile gloves
- Foldable gauze or Tyvek sheets

** Emacs Integration
- org-mode (module documentation)
- org-babel (procedural folding logic)
- denote or file-naming system for categorizing designs
- Optional: SVG diagrams embedded via babel

* Design Patterns
** Field Dressing Fold
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Bandage / First Aid
:END:
- Material: Compressed gauze
- Fold: Accordion fold with zip-release edge
- Use Case: Deep lacerations in the field
- Bonus: Can print wound-clotting instructions on layers

** Syringe Case Origami
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Gear Container
:END:
- Material: Biodegradable plastic or paper composite
- Fold: Pyramid lockbox
- Use Case: Portable, sterile single-dose packaging
- Bonus: Origami folds reveal color-coded dosage info

** Flat-to-3D Splint
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Structural Tool
:END:
- Material: Rigid origami plastic sheet
- Fold: Tesselated structure, triangle fold
- Use Case: Joint immobilization in tactical medkits

* Training Module: Origami Surgery
** Objective
Improve surgeon precision using origami manipulation tasks with surgical tools.

** Practice
- Use forceps to fold a 16-step paper crane
- Record number of tool switches and grip errors
- Level up to neuron-folding simulation (SVG overlay in Emacs!)

* Guix / Emacs Integration
** Conceptual Fold = Code Module
Just as an origami model emerges from folds, Guix modules can be seen as folds that produce a working system.

** Sample Code Snippet (base-system.scm fragment)

* Future Ideas
- AI-assisted origami unfolding: dynamic responses to injuries
- Integration with survival gear (EDC kits)
- AR headset for real-time folding instructions in surgery

* TODO Develop SVG folding diagrams using org-babel + ditaa
* TODO Create a fold-based naming convention for gear
* TODO Package into Guix modules with reproducible builds
* TODO Test motor precision training with origami in Emacs
