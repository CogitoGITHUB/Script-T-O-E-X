#+TITLE: Human Blueprints




* Emotional Manipulation
** Guilt-Tripping
   - "You know, if you hadn't done that, this wouldn't have to happen."
   - "I wonder how you’ll feel about this later… when it’s too late."
   - "You really thought you could get away with that, didn’t you?"
** Playing the Victim
   - "It’s always me who gets hurt, isn’t it?"
   - "You never seem to understand how much I’ve sacrificed."
   - "I guess I’m just too forgiving, aren’t I?"
** Gaslighting
   - "Are you sure that's how it happened?"
   - "I don’t remember it that way, maybe you’re mistaken."
   - "You always make things more complicated than they need to be."


* Power Dynamics / Dominance
** Verbal Power Play
   - "You’re really not in a position to question me."
   - "How does it feel to be so... powerless?"
   - "I could crush you in an instant if I wanted."
** Subtle Control
   - "If you just listen to me, things would be easier."
   - "You might think you have a say, but you really don’t."
   - "The sooner you realize I’m in charge here, the better."
** Instilling Fear
   - "What do you think will happen if you keep pushing me?"
   - "You can stop pretending to be in control now."
   - "You know I could make things much worse for you, right?"


* Psychological Play / Insecurity
** Undermining Confidence
   - "I’m not sure that’s the best idea you’ve ever had."
   - "You really think that’s going to work? Cute."
   - "You’re starting to look a little desperate, aren’t you?"
** Creating Doubt
   - "Are you sure you’ve thought this through?"
   - "I’m not convinced you’re even capable of doing that."
   - "I wonder if you really know what you’re doing."
** Exposing Weakness
   - "I can see right through you."
   - "You’re a lot more fragile than you think."
   - "I thought you’d be stronger than this."


* Emotional Detachment
** Cold, Dispassionate Statements
   - "I don’t care how you feel about it."
   - "Your emotions don’t matter to me."
   - "I’m indifferent to your problems."
** No Sympathy
   - "I’m not here to comfort you."
   - "Don’t expect me to feel sorry for you."
   - "Why should I care about your situation?"
** Apathetic Observations
   - "It’s not my issue, it’s yours."
   - "That’s unfortunate, but I’m still moving forward."
   - "You don’t seem to be in control of this, do you?"


* Dehumanization
** Objectification
   - "You’re just a tool for me to use."
   - "You’re not really important, just another face."
   - "You don’t matter, you’re just a stepping stone."

** Prolonging Suffering
   - "I can take my time with you, there’s no hurry."
   - "Let’s see how long you can last."
   - "You’re not going anywhere until I say so."
** Domination through Silence
   - "I don’t have to say anything for you to know what’s coming."
   - "You can beg all you want, I’m not listening."
   - "There’s no need for words, just actions."


* Psychological Control (Deeper Manipulation)
** Isolation
   - "You don’t have anyone to help you now."
   - "I’ve already taken care of everything for you."
   - "There’s no escape, not for you."
** False Hope / False Reassurance
   - "You think you’re getting away? Think again."
   - "I’ll let you think you have control, just to take it from you."
   - "You’re not as clever as you think. I’m always one step ahead."
** Mentally Draining Behavior
   - "I’ll keep you guessing until the very end."
   - "Just when you think you’ve got me figured out, I’ll change the game."
   - "You’ll wish you could have a clear thought, but I’m in your head now."


* Disinterested Meeting

** Bored Acknowledgment
   - "Oh, you're here. Didn't expect that."
   - "I guess I should be... impressed?"
   - "You could have saved me the trouble of this meeting."

** Distant Observation
   - "You’re just... another person to me."
   - "I don’t really care about your story."
   - "What makes you think I’d even remember this?"

   - "I don’t have time for this, but sure, whatever."
   - "You’re not what I came here for."

** Silent Disdain
   - "This doesn’t concern me, honestly."
   - "I’m sure you think this is important, but it’s not."
   - "I wouldn’t be here if I had a choice."

** Unimpressed Tone
   - "Is that supposed to impress me?"
   - "You're really going on about this?"
   - "I thought you'd have something worth my time."

** Cold, Unbothered Response
   - "It doesn’t matter, I’m not really listening."
   - "I’m sure you’re nervous, but it’s irrelevant."
   - "Keep talking, but I’ve already stopped caring."

** Detached Curiosity
   - "Is this how you usually present yourself?"
   - "You could’ve saved me the effort, really."
   - "You’re kind of wasting my time, aren’t you?"

** Disengaged Attention
   - "I’m not interested in whatever this is."
   - "I’m not really following, honestly."
   - "You’re talking, but it’s just noise to me."

* Human Blueprints  

** Immediate Impressions  
   The first moments of interaction reveal fundamental traits. Before words are exchanged, posture, facial tension, eye contact, and energy levels provide essential insights. Microexpressions offer subtle but telling cues about internal states.  

** Posture & Movement  
   - Relaxed → Comfort, confidence.  
   - Rigid or controlled → Formality, tension, caution.  
   - Restless or fidgeting → Nervousness, impatience.  
   - Slow and deliberate → Measured, composed.  

** Facial Tension & Microexpressions  
   - Sudden tightening around the mouth or eyes suggests discomfort or stress.  
   - A raised brow or widened eyes can indicate surprise or curiosity.  
   - Brief lip pressing or jaw clenching often signals suppressed thoughts or emotions.  

** Eye Contact & Focus  
   - Holds eye contact naturally → Comfortable, engaged.  
   - Breaks eye contact quickly → Nervous, submissive, or hiding something.  
   - Prolonged but stiff eye contact → Trying to assert control or test boundaries.  
   - Frequent darting of eyes → Discomfort, distraction, or processing information.  

** Energy Output & Presence  
   - Passive energy → Low engagement, disinterest, or reserved nature.  
   - Balanced energy → Present, comfortable, socially attuned.  
   - Overcompensating energy → Trying too hard to impress or mask discomfort.  

** Conversational Hooks  
   Speech patterns, tone, and response styles expose internal states. Mirroring suggests rapport, while hesitation or deflection signals guardedness. The way someone responds to unexpected questions reveals layers of thought and self-awareness.  

** Speech Patterns & Tone  
   - Do they mirror your tone and pacing? → Subconscious rapport-building.  
   - Do they answer briefly or expand naturally? → Comfort vs. control.  
   - Are their pauses calculated or natural? → Filtering vs. genuine thought process.  

** Response to Unexpected Questions  
   - Hesitation → Internal filtering or considering boundaries.  
   - Deflection → Guarded, avoiding personal exposure.  
   - Direct and clear → Open, little need for defense.  
   - Over-explaining → Nervousness or seeking approval.  

** Subtext & Hidden Layers  
   - Does their body language match their words? → Congruence vs. internal conflict.  
   - Are they overly neutral? → Possible emotional suppression or careful control.  
   - Do they subtly shift after certain topics? → Emotional triggers or guarded areas.  

** Deep Calibration  
   Observing consistency over time refines the read. Small details can expose shifts in their behavior, while subtle tests reveal predictability and openness.  

** Behavioral Consistency  
   - Do they maintain the same energy level and expression across topics?  
   - Do they contradict themselves subtly over time?  
   - Are they adapting to you or sticking to a fixed persona?  

** Testing for Self-Awareness  
   - If you revisit a small detail, do they remember and react consistently?  
   - Do they acknowledge subtle observations, or do they brush them off?  
   - Are they comfortable with silence, or do they fill it automatically?
